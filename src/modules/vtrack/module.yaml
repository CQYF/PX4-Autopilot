    VTRACK_ALPHA:
      description:
        short: The filtering factor alpha of the EMA filter
        long: The filtering factor alpha of the EMA filter
          determines the weight ratio between the current value
          and the historical value. The closer alpha is to 1,
          the slower the filter's response to new data;
          The closer alpha is to 0, the faster the filter's
          response to new data.
      type: float
      default: 1.0
      min: 0.0
      max: 1.0
      decimal: 3
    VTRACK_DQ_MAX:
      description:
        short: The maximum of attitude change between two visual samples
        long: The maximum of attitude change between two visual samples.
          Attitude change refers to the three-axis angle change calculated
          using quaternion differentiation and calculating its L2 norm.
          Samples exceeding this value are considered illegal.
          By analyzing the sampled raw data using MATLAB,
          we can determine what value this parameter should be set to.
      type: float

    VTRACK_DP_MAX:
      description:
        short: The maximum of position change between two visual samples
        long: The maximum of position change between two visual samples.
          calculated using L2 norm.
          Samples exceeding this value are considered illegal.
          By analyzing the sampled raw data using MATLAB,
          we can determine what value this parameter should be set to.
